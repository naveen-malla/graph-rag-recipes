(i know it seems like a waste, but the more juice you get out, the less soupy your pie will be.) mix the drained tomatoes in a large bowl with the basil, cooked onions, and crumbled bacon. add a good amount of salt and pepper to taste. make the topping. mix the cheese, mayo, hot sauce, and a generous pinch of salt and pepper in a small bowl. brush the partially cooled crust with the egg white, then spread the bottom with the dijon mustard. next, dump the chopped tomato mixture into the crust, and even it to a flat surface on top. drop the topping by spoonful on top of the tomatoes. spread it around with your fingers to create an even layer. bake at 350\u00b0 for 35-45 minutes or until the filling is bubbling and the topping is turning golden brown. allow to cool for at least 30 minutes before cutting into it. note: if you cut into this pie when it is still warm, it will fall apart. the way i see it, this is completely unavoidable. don\u2019t worry though, it will taste freakin\u2019 good anyway. the picture at the top of this post was taken the next day, after the pie was refrigerated overnight. this works well served warm, room temp, or cold from the fridge."

(or, if cooking on the stove top, simmer for about 2 hours, until desired consistency.). discard bay leaves from soup and add more dillweed, salt, and pepper to taste. soup will thicken considerably on standing. thin to desired consistency with additional vegetble stock, if desired. note* some dried mushrooms must be soaked to remove sand and grit. in a small bowl, combine mushrooms and boiling water to cover by 1 inch. cover and set aside until soft-15 to 30 minutes. lift out soaked mushrooms, rinse carefully, and cut away any gritty sections. strain the flavorful soaking liquid through cheesecloth or a coffee filter and use it in place of part of the vegetabvle broth called for in the recipe. note*quick release: if using an older model, set pressure cooker under cold running water, being careful not to run water over the pressure regulator, until no more st4am is released from under pressure regulator.open lid away from you and allow any steam to escape. alternatively, many new cookers have a stove-top release option. this method should be used with quick cooking foods that could become overcooked if allowed to stand under pressure. naturally: turn off the heat and allow the pressure to drop on its own. this gentler method may take anywhere from 3 to 20 minutes and can produce better flavor and texture-but can also overcook some foods. when a recipe says to \"let pressure drop naturally for 10 minutes\", keep the lid in place for the required length of time, whther or not the pressure has already dropped, then release any remainign pressure using the quick release mehtod before removing the lid."

(if using country ham leave salt out of beans) adjust seasoning. prepare rice as directed. when cool enough to handle, remove ham from hock, discard bone and skin, and cut meat into bite-size pieces; set aside. serve beans over rice with a couple chunks of the hock meat on top. garnish with more chopped parsley. note, i have cilantro as an option as it does have a very strong, distinct, taste that some people do not like."

        "steps": "position oven rack in center of oven; preheat oven to 350\u00b0; line the bottom of an 8-inch square or round cake pan with parchment paper and spray the sides and bottom with baking spray. cream the butter with the mixer on medium speed and gradually add the sugar, beating well after each addition. add the eggs, one at a time, and beat after each addition. in a separate bowl, dry whisk the flour, baking powder, and salt together. slow down the mixer and add half of the flour mixture to the batter; beat, then add 1/3 cup heavy whipping cream. beat, then add the rest of the flour mixture. beat, then add the rest of the cream; beat on med-high speed for about 2 minutes. grate the rind of 1 key lime; squeeze out about 1 tablespoons of the juice; add the zest and juice to the batter and beat for 2 minutes. pour the batter into the prepared pan; bake for 20 minutes. cover the pan with foil and bake for another 20 minutes (this prevents the top of the cake from browning and burning). once the cake is done (pick comes out clean), cool for 10 minutes in the pan. remove the cake from the pan to a wire rack. put a plate under the cake rack to catch the drips from the glaze. take a skewer or a toothpick and poke small holes through the top of the cake. make the glaze--mix the key lime juice and powdered sugar together in a bowl until smooth. while the cake is still warm, spoon the glaze over the cake to soak up the liquid. after you are done, you can reuse the juice pooling under the cake on the plate below the rack to further drench the cake. after the cake has cooled, dust with a little powdered sugar and serve."
