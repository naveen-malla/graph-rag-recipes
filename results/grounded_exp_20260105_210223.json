Add garlic and cook for 1 minute.\n2. **Add black beans, corn, and cumin:** Stir in cooked black beans, corn kernels, and cumin. Cook for 2-3 minutes or until heated through.\n3. **Prepare tortillas:** Soften tortillas by wrapping them in a damp paper towel and microwaving for 20-30 seconds. Alternatively, heat tortillas on a griddle with a small amount of oil to make them pliable.\n4. **Assemble enchiladas:** In a large bowl, combine the cooked black bean mixture, shredded cheese, and chopped cilantro (if using). Spoon about 1/2 cup of this mixture onto each tortilla, leaving a small border at the top. Roll up each tortilla and place seam-side down in a baking dish.\n5. **Top with enchilada sauce:** In a separate pan, combine salsa and softened cream cheese. Stir until smooth. Pour this mixture over the rolled enchiladas, ensuring they are fully coated.\n6. **Add additional cheese and bake:** Sprinkle shredded cheddar and Monterey Jack cheese evenly over the top of the enchiladas. Cover with foil and bake in a preheated oven at 350\u00b0F for 20-25 minutes or until hot and bubbly.\n7. **Finish with paprika and serve:** Remove foil and sprinkle paprika over the top. Serve hot, garnished with chopped cilantro, scallions, or diced tomatoes if desired.\n\nEnjoy your delicious vegetarian enchiladas!",
