Preheat your oven to 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C).\n2. In a large skillet, saut\u00e9 the roasted vegetables with butter, garlic, and cumin until the vegetables are tender.\n3. Add the picante sauce to the skillet and stir to combine. Season with salt and pepper to taste.\n4. In a separate pan, soften the tortillas by heating them on a hot, well-oiled griddle for about 30 seconds on each side.\n5. Fill each tortilla with the roasted vegetable mixture, followed by shredded cheese. Repeat this process until all the ingredients are used up, reserving some cheese for topping.\n6. In a separate bowl, mix the cream of mushroom soup and sour cream together. Add the paprika and stir to combine.\n7. Pour the soup-sour cream mixture over the enchilada layer in the 13x9 inch baking dish.\n8. Top with the reserved cheese and sprinkle some cilantro for garnish.\n9. Bake the enchiladas in the preheated oven for about 20-25 minutes, or until hot and bubbly.\n10. Remove from the oven and let cool for a few minutes before serving. If desired, top with tortilla chips or diced tomatoes.\n\n**Note:** You can roast your vegetables (such as zucchini, bell peppers, and onions) in the oven by brushing them with oil, seasoning with salt, pepper, and any other spices you like, and baking at 400\u00b0F (200\u00b0C) for about 20-25 minutes, or until tender.",

Add the chopped onion and cook, stirring often, until beginning to soften, about 5 minutes.\n3. Add the cooled potatoes, garlic, rosemary, salt, and pepper to the skillet. Cook, stirring occasionally, until crispy and brown, about 10 minutes.\n4. Add the diced bell peppers to the skillet and cook, stirring occasionally, until they are tender-crisp, about 5 minutes.\n5. Stir in the frozen spinach and cook until it has thawed and wilted down, about 2-3 minutes.\n6. Use a spatula or spoon to fluff the hash mixture and break up any clumps.\n7. Serve the vegetarian breakfast hash hot, garnished with chopped fresh parsley.\n\n Notes:\n\n* You can customize the bell peppers to your taste by using different colors or adding other vegetables like mushrooms or zucchini.\n* If you want to add some heat to the dish, you can add a pinch of red pepper flakes or some diced jalapenos.\n* Feel free to adjust the amount of garlic and rosemary to your liking.\n\nThis adapted recipe replaces the sausage with nothing, making it a fully vegetarian option. The addition of spinach provides a boost of nutrients and flavor, while the bell peppers add a pop of color and sweetness. Enjoy!",

In a large skillet, melt the butter or margarine over medium heat. Add the sliced onions and cook until they are softened and lightly browned, about 5-7 minutes.\n2. Add the minced garlic to the skillet and cook for an additional minute, stirring constantly to prevent burning.\n3. Sprinkle the brown sugar over the onions and continue cooking, stirring occasionally, until the mixture is caramelized-looking and fragrant, about 3-4 minutes.\n4. In a medium saucepan, bring the water or broth to a boil. Add the brown rice and reduce the heat to low. Cover the saucepan with a tight-fitting lid and simmer for 20-25 minutes, or until the liquid is absorbed and the rice is tender.\n5. Fluff the cooked rice with a fork and stir in the caramelized onion mixture.\n6.

Add this mixture to the saucepan with the onions and stir to combine.\n4. Gradually add the flour and hot mix to the saucepan, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon to prevent lumps from forming.\n5. Cook for an additional 2-3 minutes, or until the rice is cooked through and the mixture has thickened slightly.\n6. Remove the saucepan from the heat and let it cool for a few minutes before serving.\n\nNote: Since the original recipe relied on cooking the rice in a rice cooker, I've adapted this to cook the rice directly in the saucepan with the onion mixture. If you prefer your rice softer, you can add an extra 1-2 tablespoons of water to the saucepan during cooking.",
