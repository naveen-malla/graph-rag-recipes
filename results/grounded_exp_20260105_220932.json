Let sit for 5 minutes until thickened and gel-like before using in place of an egg white.\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. In a medium-sized bowl, beat the egg white until frothy.\n2. Add the sliced mushrooms, lemon zest, salt, and pepper to the bowl with the egg white mixture. Mix well.\n3. In a separate saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat.\n4. Add the flour to the melted butter and whisk together to create a roux, cooking for 1-2 minutes.\n5. Gradually pour in the vegetable stock, stirring constantly to avoid lumps.\n6. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce heat and let simmer until thickened, about 5-7 minutes.\n7. Add the chopped leafy green to the soup and cook until wilted.\n8. Using a spoon or scoop, drop small balls of the mushroom mixture into the soup pot, spacing them evenly apart.\n9. Return the pot to a boil, then reduce heat and let simmer for 4-5 minutes or until the mushrooms are cooked through.\n10. Season with salt and pepper to taste.\n11. Serve hot, garnished with tarragon leaves and a side of brown bread or crusty crackers.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* To add extra protein to the soup, you can also add cooked tofu, tempeh, or seitan in place of some of the mushrooms.\n* If using flaxseed as an egg substitute, reduce the cooking time by 1-2 minutes to avoid overcooking the mixture.\n* Feel free to customize the recipe with your favorite vegetables and herbs!",

Cut them into bite-sized pieces.\n2. **Dredge Mushrooms**: In a shallow dish, combine flour, seasoned salt, and pepper. Dredge mushroom pieces in the mixture, shaking off any excess.\n3. **Brown Mushrooms**: Heat olive oil in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Brown mushrooms on all sides (about 2-3 minutes per side). Remove mushrooms from pan.\n4. **Soften Onion**: In the same pan, add sliced onion and cook until golden brown (about 5 minutes).\n5. **Combine Sauce Ingredients**: In a separate saucepan, combine brown sugar, catsup, vinegar, garlic, and bay leaf. Whisk until smooth.\n6. **Simmer Sauce**: Bring the sauce mixture to a boil over medium heat, then reduce heat to low and simmer for about 10-15 minutes, or until thickened slightly.\n7. **Assemble and Bake**: Add browned mushrooms back into the pan with the onion. Pour the warm sauce mixture over the mushrooms and onions. Cover the Dutch oven with a lid.\n8. **Bake**: Transfer the Dutch oven to a preheated moderate oven (350\u00b0F). Bake for 30-40 minutes, or until the sauce is bubbly and slightly caramelized on top.\n9. **Serve**: Remove bay leaves before serving. Serve hot, garnished with chopped fresh herbs if desired.\n\nNote: You can also add other vegetarian alternatives like eggplant, zucchini, or bell peppers to the dish.

Top with crumbled feta cheese alternative.\n4. **Dress the salad**: Pour the dressing made in step 1 over the salad and toss gently to combine.\n5. **Toss just before serving**: Just before serving, gently toss the apples, mushrooms, and onions together again to redistribute them evenly throughout the salad.\n6. **Serve**: Serve immediately, garnished with additional oregano if desired.\n\nNote: I've replaced the bacon with a vegetable-based alternative and removed the sugar from the original recipe as it's not typically used in savory salads.

Here is the adapted recipe:\n\n**Vegetarian Broccoli Ziti Bake**\n\nIngredients:\n\n* 1 pound ziti pasta\n* 2 tablespoons olive oil\n* 1 onion, chopped\n* 3 cloves garlic, minced\n* 1 cup broccoli florets (fresh or frozen, thawed)\n* 1 cup sliced mushrooms\n* 1 cup grated mozzarella cheese\n* 1/2 cup grated parmesan cheese\n* 1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil\n* 1 teaspoon dried thyme\n* Salt and pepper to taste\n\nStep-by-Step Instructions:\n\n1. Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F (180\u00b0C).\n2. Cook the ziti pasta according to package instructions until al dente. Drain and set aside.\n3. In a small bowl, mash the garlic with a pinch of salt until you have a smooth paste.\n4. In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and saut\u00e9 until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the minced garlic and cook for another minute.\n5. Add the broccoli florets to the skillet and stir to combine with the onion mixture. Cook for 3-4 minutes or until the broccoli is tender but still crisp. Season with salt and pepper to taste.\n6. In a separate skillet, heat a tablespoon of olive oil over medium heat. Add the sliced mushrooms and saut\u00e9 until they release their liquid and start to brown, about 5 minutes.\n7. In a large mixing bowl, combine the cooked ziti pasta, broccoli mixture, mushroom mixture, mozzarella cheese, parmesan cheese, basil, thyme, salt, and pepper. Stir until everything is well combined.\n8. Transfer half of the pasta mixture to a greased 9x9-inch baking dish. Sprinkle with half of the remaining mozzarella cheese.\n9. Repeat the layers, starting with the remaining pasta mixture, then the remaining mozzarella cheese.\n10. Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake for 30 minutes.\n11. Remove the foil and continue baking for an additional 15-20 minutes or until the cheese is melted and bubbly.\n\nThis adapted recipe replaces the bacon with a flavorful onion and garlic mixture to provide a savory taste without any meat. The broccoli and mushrooms add plenty of texture and flavor, while the mozzarella and parmesan cheese tie everything together. Enjoy!",
