Add the minced tarragon and pepper, and toss to combine.\n\nStep 2: Create the Roux\nIn a small saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the flour and whisk until smooth, forming a roux. Cook for about 1 minute, or until the mixture is lightly browned.\n\nStep 3: Thicken the Broth\nGradually add the vegetable broth to the roux, whisking constantly to avoid lumps. Bring the mixture to a simmer and cook until it thickens, stirring occasionally.\n\nStep 4: Add Lemon Zest and Milk\nRemove the saucepan from the heat and stir in the lemon zest and milk (or non-dairy milk alternative). Season with pepper to taste.\n\nStep 5: Form the Mixture into Balls\nUsing your hands, shape the mushroom mixture into small balls, about 1 inch in diameter. You should end up with around 12-15 balls.\n\nStep 6: Cook the Soup\nIn a large saucepan or pot, combine the vegetable broth and roux mixture. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer for 10-12 minutes, or until the soup has thickened slightly.\n\nStep 7: Add the Mushroom Balls\nCarefully add the mushroom balls to the soup and cook for an additional 4-5 minutes, or until they are cooked through and heated through.\n\nStep 8: Serve\nJust before serving, garnish with a sprinkle of chopped leafy green. Serve hot, accompanied by brown bread or crusty bread for dipping into the flavorful broth.",

In a shallow dish, combine flour, seasoned salt, and pepper.\n2. Dredge the portobello mushrooms or tofu \"ribs\" in the flour mixture, shaking off excess.\n3. Heat 1 tablespoon of cooking oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Brown the \"ribs\" on all sides, about 5 minutes per side. Remove from heat and set aside.\n4. In the same skillet, add another tablespoon of cooking oil. Cook the sliced onion until golden brown, about 5 minutes.\n5. Add minced garlic to the skillet and cook for an additional minute, stirring constantly to prevent burning.\n6. In a separate saucepan, combine water, brown sugar, ketchup (catsup), vinegar, and bay leaves. Bring the mixture to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer for 5 minutes.\n7. Add the cooked onion and garlic mixture to the saucepan with the sweet and sour sauce. Stir to combine.\n8. Place the browned \"ribs\" in the skillet or saucepan with the sweet and sour sauce. Simmer over low heat for an additional 20-25 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened and the \"ribs\" are tender.\n9. If desired, mix 1 tsp of cornstarch with a small amount of water to thicken the sauce further. Stir the cornstarch mixture into the saucepan with the sweet and sour sauce.\n10. Serve hot, garnished with additional bay leaves or fresh herbs if desired.\n\nNote: Portobello mushrooms have a meaty texture that makes them an excellent substitute for beef ribs in this recipe. If using tofu, you can marinate it in a mixture of soy sauce, maple syrup, and rice vinegar before cutting it into \"rib\" shapes for added flavor.",

Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F.\n2. Cook ziti pasta according to package instructions until al dente. Drain and set aside.\n3. In a small skillet, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add minced garlic and saut\u00e9 for 1-2 minutes until fragrant.\n4. Add chopped onion to the skillet and cook for an additional 2-3 minutes until softened.\n5. Add broccoli florets to the skillet and stir in salt and pepper to taste. Cook for 3-4 minutes until tender but still crisp. Remove from heat and set aside.\n6. In a separate skillet, saut\u00e9 sliced mushrooms over medium heat until they release their liquid and start browning.\n7. Stir in thyme, basil, and dried onion powder (if using). Cook for an additional minute to combine the flavors.\n8. Combine cooked ziti pasta, broccoli mixture, and mushroom mixture in a large mixing bowl.\n9. In a greased 9x13-inch baking dish, create a thin layer of tomato sauce (homemade or store-bought). This will help prevent the cheese from sticking to the bottom of the pan.\n10. Add half of the ziti-pasta mixture on top of the tomato sauce.\n11. Sprinkle with half of the Parmesan and mozzarella cheese. You can use more if you prefer a cheesier casserole!\n12. Repeat the layers, starting with the remaining tomato sauce, followed by the rest of the ziti-pasta mixture, and finally the remaining cheese.\n13. Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil or a lid to prevent overbrowning.\n14. Bake for 30 minutes covered, then remove the foil or lid and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes until the top is golden brown and bubbly.\n\nEnjoy your vegetarian broccoli ziti bake!",

Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F (180\u00b0C).\n2. In a small bowl, lightly beat the egg replacement until well combined with water.\n3. In another bowl, mix together the bread crumbs, brown sugar, grated carrot, chopped onion, salt, pepper, and sugar.\n4. Add the ketchup, mustard, and beaten egg mixture to the dry ingredients. Mix well until everything is fully incorporated.\n5. Shape the mixture into an oval loaf and place it in a loaf pan.\n6. In a small bowl, combine the apple cider vinegar with 1-2 tablespoons of water to create a thin glaze (not boiling). Pour this glaze over the meatloaf, spreading it evenly.\n7. Bake the meatloaf for 40 minutes or until it's golden brown on top and firm to the touch.\n8. Remove the meatloaf from the oven and let it rest for 10-15 minutes before slicing and serving.\n\n**Optional:**\n\nTo make this recipe more interesting, you can add other vegetables like grated zucchini, chopped mushrooms, or diced bell peppers to the mixture. Feel free to experiment with different combinations!\n\nThis vegetarian adaptation maintains the sweet and sour flavors of the original while using a plant-based protein source that's both delicious and nutritious.",

Stir in 1/2 cup of chopped sauerkraut into the mixture.\n5. Shape the mixture into an oval loaf and place in a loaf pan (Note: Traditional meatloaf shape may not be possible with a vegetarian adaptation, so an oval shape is used instead).\n6. Bake at 350\u00b0F for 25-30 minutes or until the bread crumbs are lightly browned on top.\n7. In a small bowl, combine the remaining ingredients (brown sugar and vinegar) in a small amount (about 1 tablespoon) to create a topping mixture.\n8. Remove the meatloaf from the oven and spread the topping mixture evenly over the top.\n9. Return the meatloaf to the oven and bake for an additional 5-10 minutes or until the topping is lightly browned.\n\n**Note:** This adapted recipe maintains the essence of the original sweet and sour meatloaf, but replaces the beef with sauerkraut to make it vegetarian-friendly. The use of breadcrumbs helps bind the mixture together, while the garlic powder adds depth of flavor.",
